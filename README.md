# Figma Clone (Assessment)
This Figma Clone was created by me as part of an Assessment using pure HTML5 and CSS3. I have utilized media queries to ensure that the Figma design is responsive. Additionally, I have successfully used semantic elements such as header,main,section, and footer to enhance readability for others.
I have also added Comments for all sections in both HTML and CSS in order to incrase specificty.
